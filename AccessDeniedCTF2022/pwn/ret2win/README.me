AccessDeniedCTF2022 ret2win

Running the 'win' function prints the flag.

There is a function called vuln with a bof being called

Overwrite the return of that function with the address e.sym['win'] of the win function

Used cyclical pattern input and then matching whats in $eip to get return address offset in GEF

* I was off by 4 bytes..not sure why
